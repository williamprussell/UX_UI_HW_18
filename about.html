            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>To approach user 
             research I begin with a 
             proto persona. I want to
             understand the user the
             best way I can. Beginning
             with a leading statement, 
             I tend to form an initial 
             hypothesis, and use it 
             alongside my persona to 
             craft the best possible 
             research path that will 
             solve user needs. Initial
             work is carried out
             through Miro boards, 
             and pen and paper.</p><br>
             <h3>User Empathy</h3>
             <p>When I empathise with
                 users, I try to see a 
                 problem from their 
                 perspective. Drawing 
                 from problem statements
                 and other key insights, 
                 helps to understand not 
                 only if a user needs a 
                 certain problem solved, 
                 but why they need it 
                 solved. I like to spend a 
                 lot of time in the empathy
                 phase of UX design, so the
                 end result can be as 
                 tailored to the user as 
                 possible.</p><br>
             <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>
             <p>Qualitative interviews are
                 so important to the UX 
                 phase, and coming with the 
                 right questions in crucial. I 
                 like to ask leading questions 
                 where I can, and really 
                 allow the interviewee time
                 to think and describe why 
                 their answer is important to
                 their life. Creating a script 
                 that targets my persona is 
                 also very crucial, and I work 
                 to make sure everything I 
                 found out during an 
                 interview will be valuable in
                 either validating, or in-
                 validating my initial thoughts.</p>
